##Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
 Its important to choose a license in order to make it clear to other people who can use your materials and under what terms.
It's also important to choose a license in order to protect your intellectual property.

##Why You SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
you shouldn't use a project without a specific license to avoid legal troubles. If the project has no license at all, the owners have full rights, so you can't legally do anything to their code/intellectual property. If you invest in a project whose license is unclear, you risk donating to something that you didnt want to(ie. marketed as open sour but not really).

##Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher
I definatelt agree that the Web "beat" gopher, especially by following the "worse is better" methood. Gopher's mistake was narrowly defining what users wanted an tailoring their porduct toward that Ideal. However, because the Wed released a "worse" version of its product and allowed the users to choose how to imporove it, not only did they have a higher incentive to work on the web, but the web was able to become a service that had something for everyone to use and not just a few select peoples.

##licensing justification
I think its perfectly fine for Google's Andriod to use the apache 2.0 license as it allows people to customize the basic android OS to their personal specifications. Google only makes it money on software packaged with the Android os (google play, app store, etc.), which still gives developers the the freedom to tinker and toy with the basic Andorid features.
