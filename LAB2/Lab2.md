##Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
 Its important to choose a license in order to make it clear to other people who can use your materials and under what terms.
It's also important to choose a license in order to protect your intellectual property.

##Why You SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
you shouldn't use a project without a specific license to avoid legal troubles. If the project has no license at all, the owners have full rights, so you can't legally do anything to their code/intellectual property. If you invest in a project whose license is unclear, you risk donating to something that you didnt want to(ie. marketed as open sour but not really).

##Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher
I definatelt agree that the Web "beat" gopher, especially by following the "worse is better" methood. Gopher's mistake was narrowly defining what users wanted an tailoring their porduct toward that Ideal. However, because the Wed released a "worse" version of its product and allowed the users to choose how to imporove it, not only did they have a higher incentive to work on the web, but the web was able to become a service that had something for everyone to use and not just a few select peoples.

##licensing justification
I think its perfectly fine for Google's Andriod to use the apache 2.0 license as it allows people to customize the basic android OS to their personal specifications. Google only makes it money on software packaged with the Android os (google play, app store, etc.). I believe they chose this license so that indiviudals could make improvements to android overall and kind of direct the way andorid develops over the years in the way users want it too(then google can kind of follow suit and change with the market in a sort of real time) .

##example project
An example project we could do would be an rpi grade calculator app and we would give it a MIT license(just bc there are so many other grade calculators around and the only thing different about ours would be some rpi specific features)

##Which licencse is better?
GPL, Apache and LGPL licenses are better for companies who  are worried about patents, or content sharing. For example, Google uses Apache for its Android OS, which allows people to modify the basic Adroid os without infringing on patented googles Android applications. GPl/LGPL  is also good for companies because it keeps a tighter hold on how the software can be used. However, for the common good, Apache licenses might be better because they allow for the most freedom(out of the 3 given here). For independednt developers it really depends on them what license they use. It might change from project to project.
