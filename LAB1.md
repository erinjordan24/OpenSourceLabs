10 criteria of Open Source Definition: These 10 criteria are important because they prevent people 
(both developers and 'borrowers' of code) from taking advantage of each other. If a delveloper is making
an open source project, They must make it available to everyone, not just select people or groups. In addition
to making their project freely accessable to users, developers must also refrain from purposely making their software
compatible with select technologies and platforms. 

 Smart Questions How to ask the question The Smart Way :
 I really like this article because it gives me solid guide lines for asking technical questions online. Until now, I have shyed away from 
 using sites like stackoverflow to ask questions basically because I didn't know "how" to ask. This article gives some really great points
 on how to ask for help while remaining professional and concise. One guideline I would really love to add is to not be afraid to ask 
 questions in the first place. Not everyone if perfect, and even the people who end up helping you won't be perfect. Don't let 
 fear/shyness/anxiety stop you for seeking help. Also it may also be good practice to be polite to the people who answer your question 
 even if they aren't. Being rude back could turn a forum meant to help people into a social media bashing disaster.
