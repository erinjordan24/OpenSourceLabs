#Lab 4 2/19
##What we did (our Free BSD fixes)
The two errors we found and corrected included substituting a comma with parenthesis in one sentence and adding qoutes around a term
for clarity. Both of these errors were found in the Jails section of the handbook. We also fixed a thrid error in chapter 5.2 terminology, adding a hyphen to the term "on-screen".
We basically learned how to upload a fix to an opensource project through cygwin. It is important to patch opensource 
projects(and allow others to patch your work) so that the best version of your work is available to anyone who would like to use it.
