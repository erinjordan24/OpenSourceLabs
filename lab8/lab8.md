So far we have began to review the code and search for a way to set up the environment on everyone's laptops. 
not too much has been done due to exams and our group wrapping up the last bits and pieces of our rcos project, 
but as soon as week get our environment up we'll be good to edit Relax as we please. So far from looking at the 
code it may be more difficult than we thought to implement the dynamic volume setting but we'll see.
